Basic 2D Game Engine, work in progress. Don't mind the weird name.

This may become a 2D RPG engine in the future, for now it's just a little project to test some stuff. For now, focus has been on providing a few basic systems: animation, serialization, resource management, logging, error handling, and a game loop.

There's not much else to see currently, but running the project shows a very limited demo screen the user can interact with (try the arrow keys).
